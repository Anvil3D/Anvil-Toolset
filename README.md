# VGDevs-UnityTools

**VGDevs-UnityTools** is a compilation of several systems, scripts and extensions made by us and found on the internet over the years. The 3rd party scripts included are still maintained by us and, provably, heavily modified.  
Hence, this aims to be a lightweight 'framework'.  
We, as a team, use this asset every day on production apps and games.

## **Features**  
â€¢ An ScriptableObject architecture and event system, the core of the asset. Based on [Ryan Hipple's 2017 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) and [Richard Fine's 2016 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo)  
â€¢ Event System compatible with ScriptableObjects and MonoBehaviours on runtime  
â€¢ Hundreds of C# Extensions  
â€¢ Many Scripts and Components to use and "extend" Unity.  

## **Why would I want to use this?**  
We use this asset as a framework and as a base on every project, feel free to try it, its free.
