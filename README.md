# VGDevs-UnityTools

**VGDevs-UnityTools** is a compilation of several systems, scripts and extensions made by us and found on the internet over the years. The 3rd party scripts included are still maintained by us and, provably, heavily modified.  
Hence, this aims to be a lightweight 'framework'.  
We, as a team, use this asset every day on production apps and games.

&nbsp;

## **Features**  
• An ScriptableObject architecture and event system, the core of the asset. Based on [Ryan Hipple's 2017 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) and [Richard Fine's 2016 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo)  
• Event System compatible with ScriptableObjects and MonoBehaviours on runtime  
• Hundreds of C# Extensions  
• Many Scripts and Components to use and "extend" Unity.  
• Base UI to use as a starting point. Focused on performance, maintainability and scalability.  

&nbsp;

## **Why would I want to use this?**  
We use this asset as a framework and as a base on every project, feel free to try it, its free.  
Need something to fast prototype a feature or system? this is for you.

## **IMPORTANT**  
We are not reinventing the wheel, because of this, **VGDevs-UnityTools** uses other assets that are available on the store, and we **really** recommend all of them:  
• [Odin Inspector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041) (paid) - Odin is not required, but its used to organize the editor inspector and the test tools, so its heavily recommended.

• [DOTween](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676) (free) - DoTween because DoTween should be used in all projects.
