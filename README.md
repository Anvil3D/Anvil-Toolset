# OpenGameTools

**OpenGameTools** is a compilation of several systems, scripts and extensions made by us and found on the internet over the years. The 3rd party scripts included are still maintained by us and, provably, heavily modified.  
Hence, this aims to be a lightweight 'framework'.  
We, as a team, use this asset every day on production apps and games.
