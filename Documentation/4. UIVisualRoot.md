# UIVisualRoot

All `UIItems`, which are most of the UI scripts in OGT, use at least one UIVisualRoot, this child object encapsulates all the visual elements of the UIItem, this is because if you turn on and off an script, some behaviours might trigger that are not related to visual elements, and this keeps 

We recommend that you have at least 1 VisualRoot in any bit of logic/prefab/object, for example:

```
MyCustomUIItem
- UIVisualRoot
- - Background
- - Icon
- - Button
- - Etc...
``` 

Is some cases you might want to have multiple sections, you can manually show and hide any UIVisualRoot, only the ones registered in the m_visualRoots variable will be automatically handled.

We use this in the Main Menu of the [OpenRPG Client (ORC)](https://openrpg.app) to show 3 sections at the same time but with different animations.
