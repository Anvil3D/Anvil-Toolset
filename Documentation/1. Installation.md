# Installation

1. Make sure you have the `Assets/OpenGameTools` folder in your game.

--- 

2. In your initialization scene you might want to add the `GameRuntime` and the `UIRuntime` prefabs, they will auto generate anyway, but to assure 100% reliability make sure they are somewhere.

---

3. Setup the UI: 

   Go to the `GameSettings`, that you can access with the top MenuItem `OGT/Module Resources/Select Settings`

   In here you can configure your desired Sorting Layers for the UI, we recommend the default values, you might want to add more.

   ![UISettings_Sorting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1507317/234758456-e4cf39fc-3a70-41ac-b585-7099710fdb07.png)

   These values must match the actual Sorting Layers, so make sure to add them.

4. At this point **you're ready**, but to harness the full potential of the asset, we recommend the following optional steps: 

--- 

## Optional and recommended:

1. **Add the `GameRuntime` prefab** to your InitialScene or similar to ensure features such as Coroutine extensions.

--- 

2. **Create your own Module** and move it outside the OpenGameTools folder, use that Module as a base for you to start extending the functionality.

   You can do this easily with a few clicks.

   Open the CreateModule window

   ![CreateModuleMenuItem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1507317/234743915-1ff558ed-ec6e-4dd3-8c13-cc02bf96319d.png) 

   ![CreateModuleWindow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1507317/234743917-359f2fb0-4716-4519-b6ee-09906f01940c.png)

   With this, you can have things like a separated file for Settings but keeping the actual data in the same ScriptableObject. This new module will have its own `MyModule`**`SettingsCollection.cs`** that might have new variables to use and you can find them in the same file from the `Select Settings` menu item.

   ![GameSettingsScriptableObject](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1507317/234746116-7cd5eab5-4c9d-446d-88cc-d2ec3e5fc2f1.png)

   For example in the Image above, the `User`, `CoreUI` and `Spotify Integration` Modules are in the same `Settings Collection` but keeping their code in the corresponding files `UISettingsCollection.cs`, `UserSettingsCollection.cs` and `SpotifySettingsCollection.cs`

---

3. Extend the `Base<>` scripts as a parent behaviour for your scripts. For example `BaseBehaviour` instead of `MonoBehaviour`, `BaseScriptableObject` instead of `ScriptableObject` and for any script that should be in UI, use any variation of `UIItem`, check `UIItem.md` for more info.

   ```csharp
   public class MyScript : BaseBehaviour { /*...*/ }
   ```


### Notes:

> `GameResources.cs` acts as a main definitions file in static constants. If you want to personalize your OGT feel free to do so. For example: `kPluginName`

> Only `/Core` and `/CoreUI` are needed for the plugin to work, feel free to delete any other `Module` you don't need.
